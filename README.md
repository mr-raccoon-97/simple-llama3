# simple-llama3
A simple tested pytorch implementation of llama3 without fairscale.

Not only simpler but 25% faster than the original form meta: https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3

If you want to understand the transformer model I recommend you to read my implementation of a [vanilla transformer](https://github.com/mr-raccoon-97/vanilla-transformer), since I rehuse some code here.

Soon I will be adding an explanation of the Roformers.
